## So what is Specific Language Impairment??
Specific Language Impairment (SLI or specific language delay) is a curious disorder that affects [roughly 7% of 5 year old children](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/children-specific-language-impairment-0). It is characterized by a significant deficit in language ability in spite of any _obvious physical or mental disability_ such as hearing loss, neurological damage, and low nonverbal intelligence. 

I think this is best explained through an example so lets look at some real data from the [ENNI corpus](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230662487_Storytelling_from_pictures_using_the_Edmonton_Narrative_Norms_Instrument) hosted at the [CHILDES Talkbank](http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/). The children are asked to tell the same story from a wordless picture book about a young female elephant and young male giraffe at a swimming pool.

> #### 5yr-9mth old female Specific Language Impaired child 
> CHI: The elephant...s, see a garden  
> EXA: See what?  
> CHI: See a garden  
> CHI: See a see a water  
> CHI: And...s the elephant see a ball  

It's a little unclear what she's trying to convey in these sentences and the use of the determinant _a_ in front of the word water is also clearly wrong.

> #### 5yr-8mth old female Typically Developing child 
> CHI: One, one day, um, a little giraffe and um, elephant they were playing with three balls  
> CHI: And they were, they were going to go in the swimming pool

While there is some stuttering and repeating the gist of the story is clear.

## Diagnosing SLI is hard

It is better to start therapy with language delayed children sooner rather than later so a prompt diagnosis is the key to better outcomes. The problem is that the analysis of such narrative transcripts for a diagnosis is laborious for a speech pathologist or paediatrician to perform. This is where the wonders of NLP and Machine Learning come in!!
